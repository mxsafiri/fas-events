# Favicon Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.png` in `/public/` folder

   - Download the generated favicons
   - Extract to `/public/` folder

## Or Manual Setup (Next.js 13+)

Next.js supports icon files in the app directory:

### Required Files:
1. `src/app/icon.png` (32x32 or larger) - Will be used as favicon
2. `src/app/apple-icon.png` (180x180) - For Apple devices

Your logo will automatically be used as the favicon!

## What to do:

1. Save the FAS logo image to: `/Users/victormuhagachi/CascadeProjects/FAS Events/fasexclusive/public/fas-logo.png`

2. I'll create the Next.js icon file for you.
